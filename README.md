# A Very Minimal Beamer Template

This is a beamer template stripped to a very basic, without fancy navigation buttons, awkward colors and overwhelming box designs.

## Usage

Put `beamerthemeMinimal.sty` somewhere into your path, for example by linking it into your `~/texmf` folder (adjust paths as needed):

    ln -s ~/src/beamerthemeMinimal/beamerthemeMinimal.sty ~/texmf/tex/latex/

To make use of the template, put

    \usetheme{Minimal}

into your preamble.
